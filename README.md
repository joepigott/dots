# dots

[installation instructions](https://github.com/joepigott/dots/blob/main/install.md)

my dotfiles. they are guaranteed to be horribly written and very poorly 
documented but they're here.

the awesome config is especially messy, so i'm working on a full refactor at 
the moment. the directory itself has been refactored already, but i'm planning 
on ditching polybar for wibar. most of the rice is 
going to end up coming from awesome in the future.

if you run into any problems, feel free to open an issue and i will more than 
likely not get to it but i will try. :)
