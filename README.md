# dots
my dotfiles. they are guaranteed to be horribly written and very poorly documented but they're here.

the awesome config is especially messy, so i'm working on a full refactor at the moment. i'm planning on ditching polybar for wibar, dunst for naughty, etc. most of the rice is going to end up coming from awesome in the future.
