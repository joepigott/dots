# Installation

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/joepigott/dots
```

From here, copy the directories you want into your `.config` directory:

```
$ sudo cp -r [DIRECTORY] ~/.config
```

I have a few absolute paths hard-coded into the rice that you'll need:

## Wallpaper

If you want to use my wallpaper (the purple fractal), download it from one of 
these links:

[1080p](https://u.cubeupload.com/pigroy/phoenix1080p.png)

[4k](https://u.cubeupload.com/pigroy/phoenix4k.png)

Place these in `/usr/share/backgrounds/` (if you don't have this directory, 
make it).

If you want to use your own wallpaper, you can set the path to it in 
`~/.config/awesome/default/theme.lua` on line 101.

## OWM Key

To get the weather widget on Polybar, you'll need to create an account at 
[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), obtain an API key, and place it 
in a file called `~/.owm-key`. 

Next, change the `CITY_NAME` and `COUNTRY_CODE` variables at the top of 
`~/.config/polybar/weather-plugin.sh` to your city and country.
